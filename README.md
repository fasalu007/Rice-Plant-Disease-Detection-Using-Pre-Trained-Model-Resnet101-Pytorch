It is a simple image classification model build up using PyTorch, which is an optimized Deep Learning tensor library based on Python and Torch and is mainly used for applications using GPUs and CPUs. PyTorch is favored over other Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras since it uses dynamic computation graphs and is completely Pythonic.
Rice plant disease data set from Kaggl were used in this illustration. There are two separate folders for train and val. The train folder contains 80% of each classes and the rest 20% is used for validating.

We have total of 4 categories to predict Brownspot, Healthy, Hispa and LeafBlast
